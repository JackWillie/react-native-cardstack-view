An easy way to add card stack view component to your iOS, Android and Expo application that uses React Native. ‚öõÔ∏è + üì±

## Installation

**using Yarn**

```shell
yarn add react-native-cardstack-view
```

**using npm**

```shell
npm install --save react-native-cardstack-view
```

**react native link**

```shell
react-native link
```

## Usage

Example:

```js
import CardStackView from 'react-native-cardstack-view';

	<View style={styles.container}>
          <CardsView backgroundColor="#4545aa">
            <Text>Hola!</Text>
          </CardStackView>
			</View>
```

Note: it will not render correctly until you provide a `backgroundColor` prop. It accepts children props so you can manipulate and style the text inside accordingly.
